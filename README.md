How my website came to be.


### What is it?
It is my own personal website, built by hand. It includes a blog, portfolio and other features.

---

### Why?
The goal of this project is to rebuild my personal website using new frameworks. The project is not intended to be replicated but rather to show the different stages and technologies used. 

Also, to show a bit of my code - which is always open for suggestions and/or scrutiny!

---
### When will you finish?
Probably never: improvement through iteration while having fun. There will always be stuff to do.

---
### I want to try!

Then go ahead:

####1) Installation:

`npm install`

`bower install`

####2) Starting the server: 
`grunt serve`
